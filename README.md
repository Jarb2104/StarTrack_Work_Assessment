To run the project first you need to create the DB
To create the DB in the top bar menu open tools -> Nuget Package Manager -> Package Manager Console.
Once there run the 2 following commands
  1. Add-Migration FirstMigration
  2. Update-Database

Once that's done the project can be run normally.
It should open a window with a Swagger interface to call the endpoints of the WebApi.
If you want to try and run and endpoint you can click on "try out" and it should give you the ability to run the endpoint.
